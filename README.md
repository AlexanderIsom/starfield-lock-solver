# Starfield lock solver

## TODO

- [x] setup basic design and layout
- [x] improve algorithm to be faster
- [ ] make mobile compatible
- [ ] add better support for smaller resolution screens
- [ ] add a step by step walkthrough

## Details

The algorithm works by doing "the least possible" solves
it finds all the keys and creates a list of possible positions it can go
this reduces the number of combinations we have to check from millions to under or around 50

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```
